# <div align="center"> Autonomous Cars <div align="center">
  From first coining the term in 1956, to the historic match between IBM Deep Blue and chess grand master Kasparov, to the era in which many fear of it outsmarting us, AI has become more powerful than ever and continues to have a bigger mission in every aspect of our daily lives. To not be mistaken, AI greatly helps save time, effort, and most importantly, lives. With human errors accounting for 94-96% of car accidents in the US [1], having self-driving cars will wipe out that huge percentage. The development of self-driving cars has been an engineering challenge for decades. Perception, localization, prediction, and decision making are just some of the features that full autonomous cars should possess to go on the road. While the development of self-driving cars involve an array of sensors and hardware components, the market has witnessed the introduction of self-driving cars simulations provided to mine training data and train machine learning models for decision making wihtout the need of such components.

  However, the use of autonomous cars also rises ethical and legislation dilemmas. Imagine a situation where a self-driving car should choose between prioritizing your safety -even if this means sacrificing other’s lives- and minimizing overall life loss -even if this will come at sacrificing your life-. Contrary to human spontaneous reactions, AI will depend on predetermined deliberate decisions. If the car is instructed to always prioritize its owner’s safety, can this be considered a premeditated homicide? If AI goes wrong, who to blame: the manufacturer company, the programmer, or the owner of the car? These dilemmas are not far from reality. In 2018, Elaine Herzberg was hit by a self-driving Uber car and became the first pedestrian to be killed by such a car.

# Goals
 1) Collect training and test data from self-driving car simulations
 2)
 3) 
 4) Analyze the ethical dilemmas raised by the use of self-driving cars.
